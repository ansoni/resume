  I am an odd bird in that I have worn both an Operations hat and Development hat throughout my career.  Most of the reasons for this is because I go where the challenges are.  I believe this to be one of my assets since it allows me to understand the other's perspective when wearning the opposite hat.

  ReactJS
%p
  Modern web development is simply awesome.  Lots of amazing toolkits with my favorite being 
  %a{:href=>"https://reactjs.org"}="ReactJS."
  I love how AngularJS was all that we could talk about and then all of a sudden we get blown away with ReactJS.  Web development has come a long way!

  Perl was that first love for me.  I spent hours learning how to use $_ and diamond operators and all sorts of fun obfuscated things.  I also learned all sorts of other languages like Java, Python, C++, Qt...  I thought Ruby and I would die together, but it wasn't to be.  I do find it funny that Python is so popular these days and I can literally say that I programmed in it 20 years ago!

  Go Lang is my current love.  What is so great about Go Lang?  I think it really starts with the engineers behind it.  
  %a{:href=>"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike"}="Rob Pike"
  and 
  %a{:href=>"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson"}="Ken Thompson ..."
  I can't help but admire engineers who know their trade.  The logical arguments for why you do one thing over the other are facinating and the language they have created from a lifetime of experience is simply amazing.  I love that it cross-compiles, is at least as fast as C++ and gives me scripted language productivity.  For me, it is the perfect language (at least until I meet the next love).

%h3="JMeter"
%p
  %a{:href=>"http://jmeter.apache.org"}="JMeter"
  and I are very old friends.  For performance testing, it is hard to beat.  In addition to using in my dayjob, I have also added functionality to JMeter including the 
  %a{:href=>"http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#setUp_Thread_Group"}="setUp and tearDown"
  thread groups and
  %a{:href=>"http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Test_Fragment"}="test fragment"
  support.

%h3="Data Driven Documents"
%p
  I believe in data.  With data you can make better decisions. Perhaps this is the reason that I love runtime statistics and buiding reports.  My latest love is Mike Bostock's
  %a{:href=>"http://d3js.org"}="d3."
  Mike works for the NYTimes and is responsible for the awesome enrichment that the
  %a{:href=>"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/11/us/politics/who-controls-the-states-and-where-they-stand.html"}="articles"
  receive.

%h3="Automation"
%p
  Who doesn't love automation.  I am a firm beliver in never doing anything twice.  The "Internet of Things" has me really exicted as well.  Sites like
  %a{:href=>"http://www.ifttt.com"}
    "If This Then That"
  have so much potential to automate things in a normalize and elegant way.
