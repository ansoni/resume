  Culture and Creativity
%h5
  The role of a creative leader is not to have all the ideas; it's to create a culture where everyone can have ideas and feel that they're valued.

  Culture must be fun
%p
  I believe in a fun culture.  One that makes people work harder because they are involved in the idea process and are emotionally involved in its success. Fun keeps people engaged, keeps them moving forward and ultimately has them loving their work.

  Can a company work without fun?  Sure... but does anyone skillful want to work there?  These companies tend to be more brute-force.  Completing timelines through unsustainable practices.

  The Pineapple Cup

  I started a Hawaiian shirt day at Ellie Mae.  Now I know... Hawaiian shirt... very original.  The difference is that I wanted to change it up a bit so I started wearing truly bright and "noticeably" Hawaiian shirt

  Hack-a-thons
%p
  I enjoy leading hack-a-thons!  This gives engineers a great platform for thought-leadership and influencing the roadmap.  My role is to engage the developer community, be the MC for the event and help facilitate judging and excitement around the event.
